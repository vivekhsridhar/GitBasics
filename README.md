### Doing git on terminal

1. **Initialising a repository:**

        git init

2. **Cloning a repository**

        git clone <https_link_to_repository>
        e.g. git clone https://github.com/vivekhsridhar/GitBasics.git

3. **Moving a file to the staging area:**
   - Stage changes to a single file
        
            git add <relative_filepath/filename>

   - Stage all new changes
        
            git add .

4. **Take a snapshot of currently staged files:**

        git commit -m "a message relavant to this snapshot"

5. **Undo changes made in a previous commit:**
   - Undo changes in specific commit without altering commit history

            git revert <commit SHA-1>
    identifies changes made in specific commit, inverts it, and includes a second commit to reverse it

   - Undo changes by permanently deleting subsequent changes (alters commit history)

            git reset --hard <commit SHA-1>
    choosing the latest commit will remove all changes since (staged and unstaged)

6. **Send everything to the remote repository:**

        git push -u origin master
