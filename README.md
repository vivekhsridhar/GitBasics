### This is a sample README to understand git basics.

We've structured our directory to include four folders:
- Code
- Data
- Docs
- Results

#### Data collection
*Commit 1:* is a simulation of coming in with our data collected. This commit includes dummie files in the Data folder and a field_notes.txt

#### Data analysis
*Commit 2:* simulates writing code to analyse this data. This commit includes a dummie python file in the Code folder.

*Commit 3:* modifies analysis code to rid it of any bugs from the previous iteration.

#### Obtaining results
*Commit 4:* adds three new figures to the Results folder. Now we understand our data.

#### Write manuscript
*Commit 5:* includes the preliminary draft of a manuscript we wrote based on our results

#### Documentation
*Commit 6:* is this documentation, and a .gitignore file.
